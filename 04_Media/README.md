# **Media**
This code transforms microphone input into a storm of rain and lightning, inviting a reflection on how sound and emotion shape the world around us. Each raindrop becomes a word, washing over people and subtly shifting the atmosphere of their lives. Words fall like rain, bringing cleansing, renewal, or sometimes a touch of sadness. It is a living metaphor for the way communication weaves through our existence. As voices rise, the rain intensifies, echoing the energy of a protest chant.

Although the metaphor may appear abstract, I view it as a valuable opportunity for creative exploration.

**Design Choices**

- To encourage open interpretation, I chose to keep the imagery simple.

- I would have preferred to keep the key in the left-hand corner, outside, to convey a strong message as you figure out how the code works. I put it there for easy testing and marking.

- I believe the lighting would have added a shock factor if it had not been mentioned on the key.

- I added collision to the rain to portray the 'effect words have on people' message.


## Debrief
Unfortunately, I did not have the time to explore a lot of ideas for the feature in the code, such as:

- Producing Rain sounds from the microphone status without affecting it.

- Exploring different cultural imagery /or smoother animations 

- A hidden feature on the key, so it doesn't have to affect the visuals. 

- video involvement 

- Smoother collision with rain on people

There is still much to explore within this theme. I enjoyed the research process and ventured into animation by creating my own set of walking figures, which I am proud of. I also hope to find more effective coding methods and a better balance between documenting code and maintaining clarity.

### Info

- **floor()** - Calculates the closest integer value that is less than or equal to the value of a number.

- **return()** - Creating a 'new object' and sends that object out of the function so it can be used elsewhere. - could be used instead of push and pop ?

- **&&** - Operator is used when all conditions need to be true.

- **-=** - Shorthand for taking away the original value.
