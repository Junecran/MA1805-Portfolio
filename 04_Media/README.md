# **Media**
 sketch uses microphone input (sound) to generate rain and lightning — a natural, emotional metaphor. can frame this as a reflection on how sound and emotion shape perception of the environment.

Integrate images or video that represent cultural associations with rain (renewal, melancholy, cleansing, climate change, etc.).

Use audio not just as input, but as meaningful content (e.g. spoken word, protest chants, rainfall sounds).

Reflect on how your visual choices reshape those cultural meanings — e.g., turning noise (chaos) into something beautiful and natural.
**Design Choices**
- couldnt find a png that fit the style so found a way to make a parcticle without

### Info

- **floor()** - Calculates the closest integer value that is less than or equal to the value of a number.

- **return()** - Creating a 'new object' and sends that object out of the function so it can be used elsewhere. - could be used instead of push and pop ?

- **&&** - Operator is used when all conditions need to be true.

- **-=** - Shorthand for taking away the original value.
