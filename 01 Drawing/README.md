# **Drawing**

The emoji represents the challenging relationship between humans and technology. Whether caused by computer crashes resulting in lost work, programming language barriers, or anxieties about AI's influence, we must navigate both the benefits and drawbacks in our tech-centered lives.

My own experiences with coding capture this tension: I enjoy it, but its tedious and frustrating moments made me want to bite my laptop â€” a sentiment some can relate to. This feeling directly inspired the imagery of the emoji.

**Design choices**
- The cartoon style of the emoji made better storytelling visuals and kept the appearance light-hearted.
- I chose blue and red as the main colors for their symbolism. Blue represents logic and intellect, while red stands for anger and passion. Red and blue are complementary and highlight the contrast between humans and computers. At the same time, blue(computers) and red(humans) work well together both metaphorically and visually.


## Debrief

This is one of my first times coding so I focused on code readability and understanding the principles for this task.
- The task helped me learned how helpful comments and organized code can be, as they made editing faster. I have also become more confident utlizing functions and variables. 
- Next time, I hope to try a wider range techniques or make my code less repetitive.
